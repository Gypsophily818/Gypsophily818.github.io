In terms of international trade, exporting countries may become major beneficiaries of this situation, because it helps [扩大市场]expand the market of farm produce, [加速销售]accelerate the sales of agricultural output and [改善福祉]improve the well-being of domestic farmers.

[例证结论] Whoever is chosen by schools could not ensure the absolute fairness and objectivity of the selection.
教育类 - 不同能力学生互补

In addition, if students with different abilities can study together, it is out of the question that[学生受益] all the students will benefit from such a combination.
[原因句]This is simply because it helps students [互补]complement each other and give them motivation as well as chances to [互相学习]learn more from each other.
网络类 - 沉迷网络

However, over-indulgence on the Internet potentially [沦为奴隶]renders people as a slave of the Internet and computer.
[前因后果句] Due to the [缺乏面对面交流]absence of face-to-face interview and communication, [地理与心灵疏离] people are going to be, geographically as well as emotionally, isolated from each other, which further makes people [失去认同感和社会归属感]lose a sense of identity and social belonging.
健康类 - 丰富膳食、增加营养

For importing countries, those agricultural products substantiallyenrich the diet of local citizens and improve the nutrition structure.
环境类 - 加速化石燃料损耗

[解释上一句] So far there has not been a complete substitution for oil.
[建议性结局] We should not pursue short-term profit at the expense of sustainable development.
环境类 - 有毒气体排放

[有毒气体] Also, the toxic fumes - such as sulfur dioxide, released from the aircraft are the chief culprit of atmospheric contamination.
